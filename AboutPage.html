<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
Hello! My name is Chetan. I'm from a small town called Bhilai, in India. My interest in programming began a year ago, after I saw a video on YouTube about the perks and benefits offered to software engineers in big tech companies, and the oppurtunities one might encounter simply by being a part of the community that builds the tools of the future. Although that isn't the reason I chose to become a fullstack developer, but it surely was a kickstarter as it encouraged me learn more about the field and how things work.
</p>
<p>
Since then I've been working tirelessly day in and day out, in order to gather all the skills required to start a career in tech and I've been loving it. Although I'm currently in second year, persuing Bachelors in Computer Applications at Durg University. But for the most part I'm self taught, in the sense that I've learned to code on my own using various online courses and books.
</p>
<p>
I'm also a firm believer in having a strong foundation of fundamentals, inorder to build new things on top of it. My average typing speed stands at 120 words per minute, with a high of 149. Which is about three times the worldwide average of 40 words per minute. This makes me comparitively more productive as a considerable chunk of a developer's time is dedicated towards writing code.

<h1>My Past Experiences</h1>
<p>
I started a motivational, self-growth and productivity brand on Instagram with a friend in 2017 at the age of 14. Using superhero themes for our posts made them unique and special, we took our Instagram page to over 57,500 followers organically. And although we did not manufacture any products of our own, we sold some products which were relatable to our niche, and also used our audience to market other brands in the niche. Growing up, I realised it was only a hobby and finally sold the brand in June of 2021 making my first exit at the age of 18.
</p>
<p>
I also have experience in management, sales and finance as I have also been involved in my family business which includes manufacturing, distribution and retail of all sorts of clothing products. Now although these experiences might not be directly related to the field of computer science, but it is a proof that I've excelled in other fields in the past and I have great problem solving skills, persistance and the ability to adapt and grow by learning new things.
